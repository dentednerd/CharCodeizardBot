# CharCodeizard Bot
[Based on the tutorial by CosmicJS](https://cosmicjs.com/blog/how-to-build-a-facebook-bot-app-using-nodejs).

CharCodeizard, the legendary Nodemon, is here to talk to you.

You can ask CharCodeizard what it is, where it's from, its loves and hates, and its trainer's name. CharCodeizard knows some good (bad)jokes too. CharCodeizard also likes to talk about its friends at Northcoders. You can ask it "Why do you speak in third person?", but please don\'t ask "Who do you have a crush on?"
